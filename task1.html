    <p>Various lists of the <strong>Wonders of the world</strong> have been compiled for antiquity to the present day.The seven wonders of the ancient world is the oldest known list of this type,documenting the most remarkable non-made creations of classical antiquity.The number seven was chosen because the <strong>Greeks</strong> believed it represented perfection and plenty and because it reflected the number of planets known in ancient times.
    </p>
    <H2><strong>What Are the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World?</strong></H2>
    <H2><B><i>1. Great Pyramid of Giza</i></B></H2>
    <h3>Giza, Egypt</h3>
    <p>The Great Pyramid is part of a group of three pyramids, each dedicated to a different king for which the tombs were built — Khufu, Khafra, and Menkaura. The Great Pyramid refers to the grandest of them all, designated for Khufu. Covering 13 acres and using approximately 2 million stone squares, it is absolutely mind boggling that early Egyptians pulled this monument together without the help of modern technology between <strong>2700 B.C. and 2500 B.C</strong>. Even more jaw-dropping, Khufu’s mausoleum hailed as the tallest building in the world for 4,000 years. It took modern equipment in the 19th century to surpass the Great Pyramid’s height of <strong>451 feet</strong>, which could have been even taller if it wasn’t for grave robbers. All three pyramids at Giza were subject to looting inside and out. <i>Stone blocks, burial chambers, grave goods</i>, and more were stolen over time.</p>
    <H2><B><i>2. Hanging Gardens of Babylon</i></B></H2>
    <h3>Hillah, Iraq</h3>
    <p>The beautiful Hanging Gardens of Babylon were planted in present-day Iraq, near the Euphrates river by Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar II in 600 B.C… or were they? So many Roman and Greek authors mentioned the floral wonder in their literature that the royal garden at Babylon was sure to exist. Yet, these reports weren’t firsthand, and there’s no mention of them anywhere in <i>Babylonian</i> records to confirm their presence. It’s likely that the Hanging Gardens of Babylon were a widespread fictional legend, like <b>Atlantis</b>
.</p>
<H2><B><i>3. Statue of Zeus at Olympia</i></B></H2>
<h3>Olympia, Greece</h3>
<p>Although <b>the Statue of Zeus</b> was likely destroyed in a fire in the <b>5th century</b>, researchers are confident of its reality. It took 8 years for Athenian sculptor Phidias to erect the mammoth statue of the mighty <i>
    Greek god
</i>. At its height, the statue was a sight to behold, almost too bold for the naked eye. Zeus, sitting in an intricate throne of cedarwood and precious stones at 40 feet, was gilded and inlaid with ivory. His left and right hands were occupied by a pointed staff and a statue of Nike, goddess of Victory, adding to his powerful representation. There’s no doubt that you would feel a sense of divinity and godliness in the same room as Zeus at Olympia, the temple where the ancient Olympics were held. It’s a true shame that we lost this masterpiece. Zeus sat on his throne for eight centuries until Roman conquerors closed the temple in 4 A.D. The statue was moved to <strong>Constantinople</strong> where it likely perished in a fire.</p>
<H2><B><i>4. Temple of Artemis at Ephesus</i></B></H2>
<h3>Western Turkey</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, this wonder of the ancient world was not fated to live on into the present. The <b>Temple of Artemis</b> was rebuilt many times only to be destroyed over and over again. A sizable temple at <b>350 feet by 180 feet</b>, it was first built by Croesus, the king of Lydia, in around 550 B.C.E. in Ephesus, a Greek port city on the coast of present-day western Turkey. It was ornamented with gorgeous reliefs, statues, and other celebrated artworks. But the columned house may have been too beautiful for some to stand. In 356 B.C.E. (the night that Alexander the Great was born, some say), a man named Herostratus burned the famous temple down so he would be known to history. Herostratus certainly got his wish, but didn’t stop the ancient Greeks from building a second Temple of Artemis six years later. The second one, however, was met with demise after the invasion of Ostrogoths in 262 A.D. Fragments remain of the temple at the original site, and you can see some of the old columns on display at the <b>British Museum</b>.</p>
<H2><B><i>5. Mausoleum at Halicarnassus</i></B></H2>
<h3>Bodrum, Turkey</h3>
<p>The word <b>mausoleum</b> is actually derived from Mausolus, the Greek ruler of Caria, for which the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus was built. After his death in 353 B.C.E, his wife, who was also his sister, commemorated his life with a tremendous tomb. What we know of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus as it stood in the ancient world comes from the many meticulous records and observations by <b>Roman scholar Pliny</b> the Elder, who died trying to save a family from the volcanic eruption at Pompeii. He wrote that Mausolus’ immense tomb spread across 411 feet, was surrounded by 36 columns, and was mounted by <b>24 steps</b> leading to a sculpted horse and chariot. What’s more, the original mausoleum incorporated massive statues, incredible reliefs, and other artistic embellishments. It was likely an earthquake between the 11th and 15th century that reduced the mausoleum to mere crumbles. Like fragments of the <i>Temple of Artemis</i>, you can also check out a well-preserved frieze and other archaeological findings from the Mausoleum at <b>Halicarnassus</b> at the British Museum.</p>
<H2><B><i>6. Colossus of Rhodes</i></B></H2>
<h3>Rhodes, Greece</h3>
<p>Another devastating loss of art to an earthquake, the <b>Colossus of Rhodes</b> was a mammoth bronze statue of Helios, the sun god. It was molded over the course of 12 years by the Rhodians in 3 B.C.E. <b>Sculptor Chares of Lyndus</b> built the statue to commemorate Demetrius I Poliorcetes, the king of Macedonia from 294 to 288 B.C.E. Standing at 100 feet tall, gazing up at the eyes of Colossus’ colossal head was surely intimidating. Depictions of Colossus in later forms of art and in texts describe him holding a torch above a harbor’s bridge, one foot planted on one side of the bridge while the other was planted on the opposite side. This image is likely structurally impossible and only comes from portrayals during the Middle Ages.

<H2><B><i>7. Lighthouse of Alexandria</i></B></H2>
<h3>Alexandria, Egypt</h3>
<p>The pinnacle of innovation, the <b>Lighthouse of Alexandria</b> has been the blueprint for lighthouses ever since its construction in 270 B.C.E by the <b>Greek architect Sostratos</b> most likely for Ptolemy I. This ancient wonder was yet another one to be destroyed by a series of earthquakes between 956 to 1323, but was revered during its time. Based on its depiction on ancient coins, the lighthouse has three tiers, each magnificent on its own, but together create an outstanding layered tower. The first tier consists of a rectangular bottom, the second an octagonal pillar, and the top a cylinder where fire burned to warn ships on the Nile of the city’s harbor. A soaring 350 feet at its peak, only the Pyramid of Giza surpassed the Lighthouse of Alexandria’s height at the time.</p>
